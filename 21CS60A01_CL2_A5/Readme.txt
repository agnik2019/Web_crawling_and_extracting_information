I just extracted news from month of timeline and response using regex and plot the wordcloud one by one.

For timeline news it will create a folder named timeline and stores html pages.

For response news it will create a folder named response and stores html pages.

For overlapping news it will create a file  overlapping_news1.txt as well as overlapping_news2.txt and stores news there only.

Assignment 1 is merged in option 5.
